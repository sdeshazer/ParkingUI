# ParkingUI

Made By Tye Torres and Samantha Deshazer
made in Unity and adapted for Android.
This shows maps of chosen Longview parking lots where we were able to collect data of 
determining cars in spots from specific angles using raspberrypi, a camera module and
retrieving that data through rest endpoint calls to this application. 

We are able to view how many cars are within these lots in near real time.
